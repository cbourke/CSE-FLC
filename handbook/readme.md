# Resources

## System Resources

The SoC Systems Group maintains a systems-related FAQ for faculty, staff
and students available here: <https://computing.unl.edu/faq/> most
systems-related questions and issues can be answered here. If you have
an issue that is not addressed by this FAQ or have any other
systems-related questions, you can send an email to
<manager@cse.unl.edu>.

## Accounts

There are several systems and accounts that you'll have access to:

-   CSE Account -- The main CSE server, cse.unl.edu is managed by the
    systems administration staff. Account management can be handled
    through the web interface: <https://cse-apps.unl.edu/amu/amu/login>

-   Canvas -- Canvas is UNL's Learning Management System (LMS) and
    available directly at <https://canvas.unl.edu/>. Use your "MyUNL"
    login to access the LMS. This will be your primary tool as an
    instructor. You typically use Canvas for grades, to deliver course
    content and communication with students.

-   MyRed -- <https://myred.nebraska.edu> is typically used for rosters
    and final grades but there is a lot more data that is accessible in
    this system. Visit with a department secretary for getting
    additional access.

-   Firefly -- <https://firefly.nebraska.edu/> is used for HR-related
    items including pay check inquiries, tax information, benefits, etc.

## Software & Technology Resources

Information Technology Services (ITS, <https://its.unl.edu/>) offers a
wide array of software solutions and services. A comprehensive catalog
of available services is available here: <https://its.unl.edu/services/>
which includes:

- OneDrive <https://onedrive.live.com/login/>
- SharePoint <https://uofnelincoln-my.sharepoint.com/>
- Self Service <https://services.unl.edu/service/endpoint/self-service>


## Website Hosting

There are a couple of options for hosting websites as a faculty member.

-   Create a `public_html` directory and include web content in
    it which is then accessible via the url <https://cse.unl.edu/~login>
    (where `login` is replaced with your cse login). This is an
    apache server that supports CGI, htaccess, etc.

-   You can request your own subdomain website hosted by ITS
    <https://wdn.unl.edu/subdomain-request-form> which is a Drupal CMS
    (Content Management System) that automatically integrates UNL's web
    templates. Custom URLs can also be requested (example:
    gracehopper.unl.edu).

## SoC Faculty Resources

A secure faculty page is maintained by the systems administrators at
<http://cse.unl.edu/faculty/protected>. In this page you can:

-   Make room reservations for SoC-controlled rooms in Avery and Schorr

-   Access department documents including course specifications

-   Access the faculty database and update your profile/internal CV

-   Arrange a course (internships, etc.)

-   Access the department course syllabus policy and required text

In addition, several other resources are maintained by the systems
group; see <https://computing.unl.edu/quick-links/>

## ECEC

The Engineering and Computing Education Core (ECEC,
<https://engineering.unl.edu/ecec>) is a group of staff in the College of
Engineering providing professional development opportunities and
resources on teaching. Some of their resources:

-   Teaching Reflections including Peer Evaluation reflections:
    <https://engineering.unl.edu/ecec/resources-faculty/reflecting/>

-   Syllabus Template:
    <https://engineering.unl.edu/ecec/ecec-fall-teaching-templates/>

-   Peer Observation of Classroom Activities
    (<https://engineering.unl.edu/ecec/peer-observation/>) is the
    College of Engineering's required process for college-level
    teaching evaluation of all faculty.  Each faculty is required
    to go through the POCA process at least once for each major
    reappointment or promotion.

## Webhandin

The SoC maintains a web-based handin system that allows students
to submit files electronically.  :
<https://cse-apps.unl.edu/handin/> (use your cse login). As an
instructor you can:

-   Setup assignments and their due dates (with separate late and
    "close" dates after which students will not be able to submit or
    alter files)

-   Restrict file names/types using regular expressions

-   Add/remove users (students, graders, etc.)

-   View handin logs (it keeps the last 5 versions of each file handed
    in)

-   Download individual files or archives of all submissions

## Digital Learning Center (Testing Center)

UNL has a Digital Learning Center (<https://its.unl.edu/dlc/>) that
provides several services including scantron services and web-based exam
services. You can develop online exams through Canvas using Mobius
(MapleTA) and schedule time(s) for students to take the exam in the DLC.

## UNL Writing Center

Students can be referred to the UNL Writing Center
(<https://www.unl.edu/writing/>) for help with their writing
including assignments, developing resumes/cover letters, etc. The
Writing Center also provides services to faculty if you need help with
your writing or want to collaborate with them on a writing assignment or
project for your class.

## Mentorship

The Office of the Executive Vice Chancellor maintains several mentorship
resources:

- How to be a successful mentor (<https://executivevc.unl.edu/tipsheets/how-be-successful-mentor>)
- How to be a successful mentee (<https://executivevc.unl.edu/tipsheets/how-be-successful-mentee>)

The School of Computing generally identifies a senior faculty member as
a potential mentor for all new tenure-track faculty.  Speak with the
Director to identify your mentor (of course you can always switch or
identify your own mentor).  For teaching track and research faculty,
speak with the SoC Director for help in identifying a mentor.

## Advising

## Office Supplies, Textbooks, Materials

You can get office supplies as well as textbook copies from the
department staff.  

The School of Computing mainly resides in Avery Hall and the Schorr
Center.  Building maps can be found here: <https://computing.unl.edu/maps-avery-hall-and-schorr-center/>

## GTAs, UTAs, LAs

The SoC has Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs), Undergraduate
Teaching Assistants (UTAs) and Learning Assistants (LAs) to help you with your
courses.  Each group is managed by (potentially different) faculty
members.  Speak with the Director for the current faculty assigned
to each duty.

## Communication

You can send a message to all SoC faculty by emailing
UNL-SoC Faculty <UNL-socfaculty@365groups.unl.edu> available in outlook.

## Computing Education Research

As part of professional development, faculty can keep up on the latest
computing education research as published in the two major CS-Ed
conferences:

-   SIGCSE (<https://sigcse.org/sigcse/>), ACM's Special Interest Group
    on Computer Science Education (which also has an excellent listserv
    community, but ACM membership is required to join)

-   ITiCSE (<https://sigcse.org/sigcse/events/iticse>), SIGCSE's
    Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education conference

-   CCSC (<https://www.ccsc.org/midwest/>) is the Consortium for
    Computing Sciences in Colleges (we're in the midwest region)

-   ASEE (<https://www.asee.org/>) is the American Society for
    Engineering Education which is more broadly focused on all
    Engineering disciplines.

Locally, Nebraska (mostly Lincoln and Omaha) has a Chapter of the
Computer Science Teachers Association (NE CSTA,
<http://cstanebraska.org/>) where you can network with local K-12
CS-oriented teachers.

## Professional Development Opportunities

-   CoE's Engineering and Computing Education Core (ECEC,
    <https://engineering.unl.edu/ecec/>) offers a variety of
    professional development programs for faculty:
    <https://engineering.unl.edu/ecec/faculty-programs/>

-   The Discipline-Based Eduction Research group (DBER,
    <http://scimath.unl.edu/dber/>) also offers a variety of
    professional development programs including biweekly seminars.

-   Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs offers a Teaching &
    Learning Symposium once each semester with numerous breakout
    sessions:
    <https://executivevc.unl.edu/faculty/teaching-learning-symposium>

-   UNL has established a Teaching at UNL Canvas "course" which houses
    several teaching-related resources:
    <https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/51131>

In addition, you can get involved with the Faculty Senate's Teaching
Council (<https://www.unl.edu/facultysenate/teaching-council>)

# Policies

## Syllabi

-   UNL has a general syllabus policy:
    <https://www.unl.edu/facultysenate/unl-syllabus-policy>

-   The College of Engineering does not have an official syllabus
    *policy* but ECEC (Engineering and Computing Education Core) does
    have a suggested template that you are free to adopt and adapt:
    <https://engineering.unl.edu/ecec/ecec-fall-teaching-templates/> (as
    well as a Canvas course template and other resources)

-   The department has an additional syllabus policy with required text
    to be included:
    <https://cse.unl.edu/faculty/protected/SyllabusText.html> (faculty
    login required)

## Department Academic Integrity Policy

UNL has a broad Academic Integrity policy as part of the student code of
conduct (<https://studentconduct.unl.edu/academic-integrity>). The
department also maintains its own Integrity Policy available here:
<https://computing.unl.edu/academic-integrity-policy/>.

Though these policies are in place, as an instructor it is up to you to
define what constitutes a violation of this policy. Your own
course-specific policies should be well thought out and clearly stated
in your syllabus. Violations of the integrity policy and actions taken
against a student must be reported to the department's Academic
Integrity & Grading Appeals Committee.

## 15th Week Policy

UNL has a 15th week policy colloquially known as the "Dead Week Policy"
(see <https://studentaffairs.unl.edu/sa_policies_deadweek.shtml>). This
policy is intended to prevent "surprise" assignments or exams at the end
of the semester. If you want to assign any substantial assignments
(homework, exams, etc.) you need to do so in writing prior to the 8th
week of classes.

It is best to have your course as well as all assignments and due dates
completely planned out at the beginning of the semester and make this
schedule known to students to avoid violating this policy.

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act is a federal law that
prevents faculty and staff from violating a student's privacy with
respect to any academic record(s) (grades, flags, contact information,
addresses, etc.) that you have access to.

You should never make any identifying information publicly available or
discuss the performance of a student with anyone who is not bound by
this law (other faculty/staff employed by UNL are bound by this law)
unless the student has signed a FERPA waiver.

## Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)

UNL provides counseling services through CAPS (<https://caps.unl.edu/>)
for students (free unlimited sessions). If you believe a student needs
such services, please refer them to CAPS.

## Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD)

Students with a documented learning disability or other impairment that
requires accommodations should be registered with the SSD office
(<https://www.unl.edu/ssd/home>). SSD will handle deciding the
appropriate accommodations and working directly with a student and their
doctor to protect their privacy. It is a student's responsibility to
provide the proper paperwork and you can choose to have the SSD office
provide the appropriate accommodations (proctoring in a distraction free
environment, extended time on exams, etc.).

## Greeks, Honors, Scholarships, Student Athletes, ROTC, etc.

Other student groups will often ask for accommodations and/or grade
checks. Making accommodations are generally not required for these
groups but you should make reasonable efforts to do so in order to
support the student.

UNL Honors students may want to "contract" your course for honors
credit. Generally, the extra requirements to fulfill this are up to you
and the student.

# Whom to Talk to About\...

Current faculty committee chairs and member lists can be found here:
<https://computing.unl.edu/faculty-committees/>.  Speak with the chair
of the relevant committee or faculty/staff group for your questions(s).
