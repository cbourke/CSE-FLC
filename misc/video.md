# Video: Software & Tools

I've gotten a few questions about the various tools and software I use for 
video publishing.  I thought I'd make a more detailed writeup and share it
with the rest of the faculty.  Please feel free to share this with anyone
who has similar questions and/or to send me your own suggestions.

First, you might find my (older, pre-COVID) video presentation at the
Century Club (October 2019) useful where I talk about some of this
stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6M6Gt9-fE 

## Software 

### Open Broadcast Software (https://obsproject.com/)

This, frankly is the gold standard for video recording and livestreaming
(it supports both YouTube and Twitch) and it is free!  It is essentially
a self-contained video studio that allows you to setup "scenes" of various
video and media sources, add effects, easy transitions, etc.  It is
ideal for livestreaming but I've found it to be superior to other software
even for off-line recording.  It *is* resource intensive.  I'm forced 
to stream in 720p not because of lack of bandwidth but due to video 
processing.  My 4+ year old Mac is not able to handle the 1080p 
processing and it also tends to slow the rest of my system down but 
it is not a show-stopper.  Just have a decent machine.  I've also 
been forced to use an external fan cooler because it does run HOT.  

Its only shortcoming is that it is *not* a video editing tool.  My 
current workflow is to record with OBS and edit in Camtasia (see
below).

### Camtasia

There is a lot of video editing software out there, but Camtasia
seems to be the best bang for your buck (education, single license
is $170, see https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia-pricing.html).
I use it for *all* of my editing.  I used to use it for video/screen
recording and it is adequate for that job but not nearly as good
as OBS (OBS's chromakey or "green screen" capabilities are *far*
superior; Camtasia really falls short on this).  It has really good,
stable and efficient non-linear editing (cutting and splicing 
video segments).  It also has a lot of nice animation and audio 
effects.  


### Vidgrid

UNL had had Vidgrid for quite a while now (see 
https://its.unl.edu/services/unl-academic-video/ for details).
You can use the software itself in any room or on your own 
machine to record your screen.  When used on your own machine
it is pretty reliable and straightforward.  It can record
locally and can automatically upload the video to be hosted
by UNL/Vidgrid servers which students can stream from.  It
offers *some* editing features but they are not very extensive
at all (you can mostly cut the start/end of the video if you 
need to).  

Alternatively, some of the larger lecture halls have automated
capturing capability.  It can be configured (by the admins) in
a few ways but the default is to capture a camera stream of 
you/the stage with a capture of the main display (whatever 
the students in the class are seeing) side-by-side.  You do have
to schedule it though.  I've had hit-or-miss experience with this
so you'll either want a plan B if/when it fails to capture or
go with the manual solution described above.

### Misc

* UNL has two "One Button Studios" on campus (one in Adele, 
one in Henzlik with a *lightboard* setup): 

https://its.unl.edu/services/one-button-studio/

You can use these studios to record a presentation at the
touch of a single button.  

* UNL's Communications department has published many design 
templates and other assets including video intros/outros that
you can use in your presentations; see here: 

https://ucomm.unl.edu/brand/templates-assets

* A nice tool I found was Quick Camera (free, Mac, 
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quick-camera/id598853070); it allows
you to display the output of a webcam (or any USB camera) to a
window that you can move/resize on your desktop.  I use a
webcam with this software to have a DIY doc cam setup (see below)

* GoodNotes (Mac, $8, https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodnotes-5/id1444383602)
is a nice "note taking" software that I use to
draw diagrams (or overlay drawings on diagrams)


## Equipment

### Lights

Good lighting is essential for decent video capture and absolutely
necessary if you are going to use chromakey effects (lighting has
to be even).  I use tripod mounted LED arrays (USB powered, so you
may also want to get a couple of USB power strips: 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DW646GY/): 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T8FBZC2/ 

### Cameras

Most newer webcams built into a laptop will suffice (most are 720p).
I've found Mac cameras to be generally better than PC laptop cams, but
it never hurts to have an external webcam (or two).  Most are going
to be USB so make sure you get proper adapters (if necessary) and 
maybe a USB hub (powered) if you're going to have a lot of USB devices.
You may also want to get a table top tripod or a full camera tripod 
if you want to position it better.

### DIY Doc Cam

Most of the classrooms are going to have doc cams (overhead projectors
but with digital cameras that output via VGA or DVI).  Likely you
don't want to be breaking these down or unhooking them in the classroom
though.  You can buy one yourself you want, but why when you can have
the same effect for cheap.  Get yourself a *gooseneck camera mount* and
use a simple USB webcam.  Here's the version I use which has a USB
LED light so that your writing surface is lit properly:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G379ZBH/ 

You can mount it anywhere and infinitely adjust it!

### Microphones

Though most built-in laptop webcams are okay, most built-in
microphones are terrible.  A lot of external microphones 
are equally terrible which is strange because you don't
have to spend a lot to get decent quality ones.  If you are
in a desk studio situation, you'll definitely want to get 
a dedicated, quality USB microphone with a boom mount and
pop guard (believe me a pop guard is *necessary*).  Here 
are the ones I use:

* Mic ($50): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XCKGLTP/
* Boom + pop guard ($30): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GRMF5ZE/
* Alternative/more compact all-in-one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WLWN2ZT/

Of course, most classrooms will have a wireless lapel mic, but
it remains to be seen if you can capture that in your own 
personal device.  You can always get your own wireless or wired
omnidirectional lapel mic as well.

Other bells and whistles if you really want to go whole hog:

* Shock Mount - this protects the mic from picking up bumps from
your desk if you fidget a lot or are a hard typer.  Most boom
mounts allow you to attach standard shock mounts
* Isolation Shield - if you are in an area with lots of ambient
noise and isolation shield can help filter most of it out without
having to sound proof your entire setup.

### Headphones

Headphones aren't necessary for most recording applications, but
I mention it here because if you're going to zoom you should consider
using one.  Zoom is okay about reducing feedback but it does so by
lowering the output volume when it detects you speaking and often
you get the equally annoying effect of people talking over one another
without realizing it.  Wearing headphones solves both of these problems.
It also helps keep you tethered and engaged in Zoom presentations and
meetings :)  My only recommendation is against using bluetooth 
headphones in general (due to lag) and especially ones with 
microphones because they like to magically connect/disconnect at
will.
